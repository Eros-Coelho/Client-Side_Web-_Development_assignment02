                    <p> The internet saw a surge of popularity on the Western world during the 1990's, and thanks in no
                        small part to the
                        development of the World Wide Web at CERN (Segal, B., 1995). CERN (European Organisation for
                        Nuclear Research, or
                        “Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire”) is one of the largest particle physics
                        laboratories in the world,
                        home to the large hadron collider, and the birthplace of the World Wide Web.</p>

                    <!--World Wide Web images gallery | CERN-->
                    <p>Not unexpectedly, the scientists at CERN were not the first to try and develop an integrated form
                        of communication
                        that in the 21st century is called internet, as computing pioneer Vannevar Bush, who first
                        defined the Web's fundamental
                        principal, hyperlinked pages, in 1945 (Kelly, K., 2005); but CERN was the first organisation to
                        develop an intricate system
                        for data communication, almost half a century later.

                    <h3>Before That</h3>
                    <p> Segal (1995), who was the first TCP/IP (as Internet protocols were then called) Coordinator at
                        CERN, also states
                        that the situation of data communication inthe early 1970's was chaotic, much like the main
                        projects at the laboratory.
                        Several companies vied for the possibility of defining national or even international standards.
                        Needless to mention,
                        this made real progress more complicated since there were too many different methods and
                        techniques</p>
                    <p> Though the Web was officially accepted around the years of 1993 and 1994, it had been originally
                        prototyped on 1991,
                        and even before the Web itself, the professionals at CERN were vehemently prohibited to have any
                        external
                        connections using TCP/IP, (Segal, B., 1995). Internet as is known today would
                        only be available to the public for at least 10 more years of developing.</p>

                    <h3>On the Deacdes After</h3>
                    <p>The Web had a quiet start on Christmas Day on the 1990's (McPherson, S.S., 2009), though it
                        became popular very
                        quickly. Surely one of the most fantastic innovations of science at the 20th century. The Web
                        creator Tim Berners-Lee
                        (McPherson, S.S., 2009), compared the rapid growth of machines utilising his creation to a
                        bobsled, as it increased
                        steadily, but once it started, its figures sky-rocketed. The graph below shows how, in 13 years,
                        from 1993 to 2006, the
                        number of users increased at an impressive rate of almost 400 times; and, as is common knowledge
                        in the second decade of
                        the 21st century, it would only grow more.</p>

                    <p>Within the next decade, computers would become smaller, more powerful, and cheaper (McPherson,
                        S.S., 2009), as some
                        of the greatest minds of the 20th century worked on them. The development of the Web and more
                        advanced software programs
                        was of paramount importance, even if, at the time, they did not know yet exactly how it would
                        all turn out.</p>

                    <img src="./images/Sir_Tim_Berners-Lee.jpeg" alt="A photo of Sir Timothy Berners-Lee">
                    <!--Clarke, P., 2014-->
                    <p>The man responsible for developing the World Wide Web, the British computer scientist Timothy
                        Berners-Lee. Since a
                        young age, Tim's life was overshadowed by computers and programming, being the son of two
                        respected members of the
                        field.</p>
                    <p>In 1976, Berners-Lee graduated from Oxford University with a degree in physics (McPherson, S.S.,
                        2009), and inspired
                        by his parents and by the “fun” he had had in building his own computer in college, he began to
                        interview for jobs
                        in that area, eventually coming to work as a software engineer at Plessey Telecommunications.
                        Acquiring the
                        necessary experience, Tim changed jobs only one time before deciding to leave and becoming an
                        independent consultant at the
                        end of the 1970's.</p>
                    <p>The next step for him would prove to be the most important one, not only for himself, but for the
                        world. Tim received
                        an offer from his friend Kevin Rogers to go to CERN in Switzerland (McPherson, S.S., 2009),
                        where he took a
                        six-month position, at first, where his main responsibility was to keep track of the scientists'
                        experiments using
                        computers and software programs. Tim's work helped the researchers in making it easier to
                        organise the data, being
                        able to simply type in the name of the scientist or experiment and have all relevant information
                        stored presented to
                        them as quickly as possible.</p>

                    <h3>Web Pioneers</h3>
                    <p>After Vannevar Bush in 1945 (Kelly, K., 2005), another scientist tried to accomplish what Tim
                        envisioned for the Web.
                        Ted Nelson, twenty years later, in 1960's, developed the hypertext, as he named it (McPherson,
                        S.S., 2009). It
                        allowed users to not simply read pages in an orderly, sequential way, but to offer them options
                        as to where go next.
                        The system consisted in links inside the pages, where one could click and be taken to a
                        different page that
                        elaborates on the topic. For example, if a user is reading a page about Ireland, and in the text
                        the word Dublin is
                        highlighted, they could click on it and be taken to an article specifically about Dublin.</p>
                    <img src="./images/hyperlink.png" alt="image showing how hyperlink works">

                    <p>Not arrogantly, Nelson hoped that one day all human knowledge would be linked through hypertext,
                        even going so far as
                        to name his project “Xanadu”, after the mythical place of luxury (McPherson, S.S., 2009). In a
                        way, his wish came true.
