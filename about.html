    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p><em>Eros Lima Coelho</em></p>
    <img src="./images/Eros-photo.jpeg" alt="a photo of myself">
    <p>I am an international student at Griffith College Cork coming originally from Brazil. My country has quite a lot of
        proud members living in Ireland, though I am, unbfortunately or not, not one of them. I loev Ireland and all the
        rest of Europe, and wish to travel through all the countries I can. I do not care for warm weather and beaches,
        preferring much more the cold and occasional rain of the Emerald Isles. I am currently studying Computing Science, which
        is, of course, a fascinating field, however, I am still not entirely sure this is what I want to do for life; my
        aspiration has always been to be part of the academic world, lecturing on high level education institutions, being a
        scholar, and I am not as well versed in technology as someone my age should be, though I have a good enough grasp of the
        concepts seen in class so far.</p>
        <p>For my free time and leisure, I am not for drinking and dancing, rather playing games with friends or simply going
            somewhere to talk and make jokes. I would say my favourite past time and hobby is TTRPGs, most specifically the game
            Vampire the Masquerade; there are dozens of books, comic books and electronic games about this unoiverse, and honestly
            there are few things taht entertain me as much as this.</p>
    <p>I am someone who doesn't like to have many friends, but a selected few with whom I feel extremely comfortable. I may
        be difficult to deal with sometimes, some of my friends complain when I don't take things seriously, or make too
        many jokes, and I appreciate having people to bring me back to reality when my mind wanders too far.</p>
